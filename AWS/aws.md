virtual machines:


ec2 is aws service to launcH an instance


i downloaded a pem file:

i then had to move it to .ssh
``` 
mv ~/Downloads/tech257.pem ~/.ssh/tech257.pem
 ``` 

once there we change the permissions
``` 
chmod 400 tech257.pem
``` 

Then we make a security group



sudo apt update -y

Make sure port 80 and 22 are open at minimum.
