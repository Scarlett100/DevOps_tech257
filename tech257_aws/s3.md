Amazon S3 is a type of Object storage that can get any amount of data from anywhere, its benefits are:
* Scalability
* security
* availability
* cost effective

### Using S3 with aws cli 
We had to make an `ubuntu 22.04 lts` instance with `ss` named tech257_morgan_learnS3 and ssh in



### Installing dependencies 
**1.** First we need to do an update & upgrade

```
# Update and upgrade packages
sudo apt update -y
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get upgrade -y
```

**2.** Check python version

```
python3 --version
```
![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-04-15 at 10.34.43.png>)


**3.** Install pip
```
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
```

**4.** Install aws cli
```
sudo pip install awscli
```
**5.** Check version

```
aws --version
```

![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-04-15 at 10.39.12.png>)

**6.** Redirect python to read python commands as python 3 so we don't have to type aws every time, will need to do this every time you're ssh in.

```
alias python=python3

```

**7.**
```
python --version
```
We can see it works!

### How to authenticate using aws cli

**8.**

```
aws configure
```

give your access key and secret key.

default region: `eu-west-1 `

default region for commands: `json`


Then to check  you are in type
```
 aws s3 ls
 ```
![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-04-15 at 10.56.25.png>)

As you can see I have set up s3 on my instance and logged in


**10.** if you need help
```
aws s3 help
```
### How to use CRUD mathods using AWS CLI
**11.** **CREATE** a bucket
```
aws s3 mb s3://tech257-morgan-first-bucket
```
![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-04-15 at 11.01.16.png>)

```
aws s3 ls s3://tech257-morgan-first-bucket
```



**11.** **CREATE**  a populated test file on the instance
echo hello, this is a test > test.txt

# **read files**

Do an ls
**12.** cat to screen
cat test.txt

**UPLOAD DATA TO S3 AND DOWNLOAD DATA FROM THE S3 BUCKET** 
****13.** 
To upload to specific s3 bucket we do a copy:
```
aws s3 cp test.txt s3://tech257-morgan-first-bucket
```

**14.** 
check
```
aws s3 ls s3://tech257-morgan-first-bucket
```

**15.** 
```
mkdir downloads
```

**16.** 
```
cd downloads
```

**17.** 
sync bucket to current directory, the full stop does this

```
aws s3 sync s3://tech257-morgan-first-bucket .
```

**18.** 
if we do an `ls` after it is there

**DELETE**
**19.** 
How to delete a file from the bucket
back in home:

```
aws s3 rm s3://tech257-morgan-first-bucket/test.txt
```
![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-04-15 at 11.21.46.png>)

**20.** 
put it back in s3 (it still lives on the instance)

```
aws s3 cp test.txt s3://tech257-morgan-first-bucket
```

**21.** 
we can see it has been uploaded and is back
![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-04-15 at 11.23.10.png>)

**22.** 
To remove all files in bucket

very dangerous!!!

aws s3 rm s3://tech257-morgan-first-bucket --recursive
**23.** 
Check bucket is empty

It doesn't give you a prompt so you must be sure of what you are doing.
aws s3 ls s3://tech257-morgan-first-bucket

**24.** 
```
aws s3 rb help
```
:warning:
to delete bucket and everything inside it:
Only need to use force when the bucket is not empty.
<br>
```
aws s3 rb s3 s3://tech257-morgan-first-bucket --force
```



my task:


```
pip install boto3
```
![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-04-15 at 11.56.18.png>)


**1.** Redirect python to read python commands as python 3 so we don't have to type aws every time, will need to do this every time you re ssh in.

```
alias python=python3

```

**2.**
```
python --version
```

```
