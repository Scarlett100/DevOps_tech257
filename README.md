# How
How I moved everything to one place:


First on my local machine I went to each repo and did a 

```
ls -a
```
To check there was a .git folder present.

Once there was I then removed the git folder.

```
rm -rf .git
```


Then finally I dragged the folder into this and and pushed to git. Easy Peasy!
